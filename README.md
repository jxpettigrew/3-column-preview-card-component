## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

On this one, I learned that best practice is not to give buttons values for height or width, only padding. This seems to ensure the text won't overflow the button borders.

### Continued development

This was just meant as a quick little project to apply some things I've already learned, but I definitely want to get involved with more complex flexbox and grid designs on my next project(s). Also intend to start adding some interactivity with Javascript very soon.
